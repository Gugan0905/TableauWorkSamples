# Gugan's Tableau Work Samples
This repo contains links to a few samples of Tableau dashboards I have practiced on.

- Example #1
  - A dashboard on the house sales data of Kings County, WA (inspired from youtubers like Mo Chen).
  - This dash features housing features and sales data - [link to dataset](https://github.com/mochen862/king-county-house-sales)
  - It includes features like:
    - Pricing trends like Avg Home Price, ang Avg Price/sqft over time
    - Distribution of Bedrooms and bathrooms
    - Geospatial maps over average price and year built
    - and more in depth analysis using trends and Calculated Fields
  - With all visualizations working on user input of Date Range.
